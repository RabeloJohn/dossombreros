        Dos Sombreros restaurant opened its doors in the spring of 2012 in the
        heart of the bustling south lanes of Brighton. In the autumn of 2013 we
        opened our ‘Day of the Dead’ themed tequila and cocktail bar above the
        restaurant. Containing original pieces of artwork from Jony Daga (check
        out his work in our gallery section). <br /> <br />
        Dos Sombreros tequila and cocktail bar opened on the third floor of our
        Mexican restaurant in November 2013. A perfect place to have drinks if
        you are waiting for friends to arrive, or a private party. We also offer
        tequila tastings and cocktail classes.
        <br /> <br />
        For reservations, kindly call us on 01273 911 455.
